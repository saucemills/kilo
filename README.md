# kilo: Powerlifting Toolbox is on the iOS App Store at: 
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kilo-powerlifting-toolbox/id1516140604?ls=1

This was my first app published to the App Store. It was written with Swift 5, using Storyboard and
some programmatic functions.


The kilo app provides 3 separate features that can help someone interested in powerlifting or weightlifting:

1) Kilo converter and bar loader: all powerlifting and weightlifting competitions, even in America, 
are performed using kilo plates. Knowing how much weight is on the bar and the pound conversion 
is difficult for many people. The kilo app makes it easy in that they can load the exact plates that 
are on the bar, including specifying the size of the bar and whether weighted collars are on, and get 
the exact amount on the bar in kilo and pounds.

2) A one rep max calculator that cuts out the formula and all you have to do is enter the weight you 
lifted and for how many reps and the program will tell you what your approximate one rep max is based 
on that information.

3) A rpe calculator. Many powerlifting programs use RPE(or rate of perceived exertion) instead of 
percentages to determine working weight. If you are not experienced, knowing what weight to work at 
can be difficult. The app makes it easier. You enter your max weight for the particular lift as well 
as the rep and RPE targets and the program will generate an approximate target weight for you to aim for.
